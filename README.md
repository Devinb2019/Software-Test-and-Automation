Software Test and Automation
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my software is functional, I rely on writing thorough unit tests that cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases. These tests help catch bugs early, ensuring each component works as expected. For security, I follow best practices like input validation, error handling, and regular code reviews. Using these strategies helps me maintain both the functionality and security of the software.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs starts with clear communication. I focus on understanding the requirements by discussing them with stakeholders and translating them into concrete features and tasks. I often use user stories to keep the end-user in mind, ensuring the program meets their expectations. By aligning development with these needs, I can create software that is both useful and user-friendly.

How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design is centered on modularity and simplicity. I break down the program into smaller, manageable parts, each with a clear role. This makes the software easier to develop, test, and maintain. I also aim for a design that can adapt to future changes, using design patterns where applicable. This approach helps me build software that is reliable, scalable, and easy to work with.
